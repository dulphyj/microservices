# Microservices Development and Deployment in the Cloud with Spring

## Description
This repository contains the code and resources for the course "Learn to Develop and Deploy Microservices in the Cloud Using the Spring Framework". The course covers a comprehensive guide to building and deploying microservices using Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Docker. The project aims to provide you with hands-on experience in implementing and managing microservices, securing them, and deploying them to the cloud.

In this repository, you will find examples and implementations for creating RESTful microservices, integrating them with databases using Spring Data JPA, documenting them with Spring Doc and Swagger, and securing them with OAuth2. Additionally, the project includes configurations for deploying microservices with Spring Cloud and Docker containers, simplifying cloud deployment.
